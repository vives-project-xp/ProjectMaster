## Backup in google drive


### Detailed Install Instructions
1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on Store (Bottom Right).

2. Click the 3-dots menu at upper right ... > Repositories and add this repository's URL: https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup


3. Reload the page , scroll to the bottom to find the new repository, and click the new add-on named "Home Assistant Google Drive Backup":


Note: Home Assistant loads the repository in the background and the new item won't always show up automatically. You might need to wait a few seconds and then "hard refresh" the page for it to show up. On most browser the keyboard shortcut for this is CTRL+F5. If it still doesn't show up, clear your browser's cache and it should then.

4. Click Install and give it a few minutes to finish downloading.

5. Click Start, give it a few seconds to spin up, and then click the Open Web UI button that appears.

6. The "Getting Started" page will tell you how many backups you have and what it will do with them once you connect it to Google Drive. You can click Settings to change those options through the add-on (which is the recommended way, they take effect immediately), or update them from the page where you installed the add-on as described below (also works, restart for them to take effect).

7. Click the Authenticate with Drive button to link the add-on with your Google Drive account. Alternatively, you can generate your own Google API credentials, though the process is not simple.

8. You should be redirected automatically to the backup status page. Here you can make a new backups, see the progress of uploading to Google Drive, etc. You're done!
