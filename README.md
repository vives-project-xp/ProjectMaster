## Short Description

Home Assistant is a Central Management System for projects made by students.
This project uses MQTT, home-assistant, GitHub, node red and Node.js. With this management system, our aim is to interact with other projects or devices to make them available all within a central place.
Using this system, you can use a basic interaction to turn a device on or off, change color, change a scene and more.
