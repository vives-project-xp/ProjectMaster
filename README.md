## Short Description

Home Assistant as central management system for projects made by students.
This project uses MQTT, home-assistant, GitHub, node red and Node.js. With this management system, we have the aim of interacting with other projects or devices to make them available in a central place.
With a basic interaction to turn that device's on or off, change color, change scene and more.
